      %h3 Household Identifier
      %p
        A Household ID will be assigned to each household at each project start and applies for the duration of that project stay to all members of the household served.
      %p
        The Household ID must be automatically generated by the HMIS application to ensure that it is unique. The Household ID has no meaning beyond a single “household enrollment”; it is used in conjunction with the Project ID, Project Start Date, and Project Exit Date to link records for household members together and indicate that they were served together.
      %p
        The Household ID is to be unique to the household stay in a project; reuse of the identification for the same or similar household upon readmission into the project is unacceptable.
      %p
        Persons may join a household with members who have already begun a project start or may leave a project although other members of the household remain in the project. A common Household ID must be assigned to each member of the same household. Persons in a household (either adults or children) who are not present when the household initially applies for assistance and later join the household should be assigned the same Household ID that links them to the rest of the persons in the household. The early departure of a household member would have no impact on the Household ID. A household member who leaves and returns to the same household while others in the household remain enrolled should be reassigned the same HouseholdID as that member’s earlier enrollment.
      %p
        An HMIS may, but is not required to, utilize a Global Household ID at record creation upon initial entry into an HMIS based on the person(s) presenting together as a household at the time of initial entry. A Global Household ID is a value which spans an entire HMIS implementation representing a collection of persons who have been in a household together. Assignment of a client in or out of a global household at a specific project need not immediately affect the client’s data at other projects. If, for example, one household member exits from a household in project A and that household is also being served in project B, there is no requirement to alter the household configuration at project B.
