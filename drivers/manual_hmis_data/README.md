## ManualHmisData README

This driver provides the ability to create manual associations for Projects:
Funders, Inventories and Project CoC Records. Generally speaking these
associations are brought in via import, but there are cases where one of them
may come from a source that cannot be imported, such as when an Inventory is
provided by the VA/HOMES. Importing will not remove or override these manually
added associations.
