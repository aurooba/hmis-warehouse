## PerformanceMeasurement README

The Performance Measurement report is a summary report which is mostly based on calculations from the SPM.  The report is run for one or more CoCs and includes a 1 year look-back, with a comparison to the prior year. The report is always run as a privileged user and includes all relevant projects in the CoC.  Drill-downs to client level data are limited to those with access to the specified projects.
